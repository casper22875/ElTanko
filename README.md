This being my first ever README please bear with me.

The code that appears in the repository is not completely my original.

It was developed by another and sent to the web to be used as a tutorial.

There are some things initially missing in the original
	repo that should be brought to light to help others.
	
First I would like to point out that there are 2 media files.

Both are exactly the same and both are necessary to run thru the tutorial properly.

This was a hiccup on the original authors part. I hope to fix
	this issue in future pushes to the repo.
	
There was HUGE problem installing Rmagick.

I am sure as time wears on that other image editors will become
	compatible with Ruby. For now we have Rmagick.
	
I finally got this to install after wiping Ruby completely from my C drive,
	and reloading gems very, very carefully. To avoid the common
	'no install/no lib/cant make the Makefile err among others, I was sure I loaded
	the core gems first, then the problem gems, then all others that are very stable.
	
I managed to get a majority of problem gems to load. Couldn't get the Gosu_Releasy to install.

Of course I have no intention of deploying this game so I can worry about that later.

Some of the other roadblocks were dealing with JSON files and how to parse those
	and get them to run like they should. The original tutorial does
	explain this pretty well and if know already how to work with JSON files
	this part of the tutorial will be easier.
The further I go thru this tutorial the more I will add to this README.
